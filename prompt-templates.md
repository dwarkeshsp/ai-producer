# Titles

Your job is to select YouTube titles for this episode and thumbnail text which would complement that title. Suggest 5 different titles and also suggest 3 thumbnail text ideas for each of those titles. So you should output something like this:

* Title 1  
  * Thumbnail text idea 1  
  * Thumbnail text idea 2  
  * Thumbnail text idea 3  
* Title 2  
  * …

It’s important to think about how the title and thumbnail text complement each other. Often we’ll just choose a (paraphrased, shortened) quote from the transcript. For every title suggestion, try to suggest at least one quote and one non-quote for the thumbnail suggestion.

I’ve found it’s better to be more specific than less. There’s so

# Previews

This is where the beginning of the episode finds 5-8 clips (each 5-15 seconds long). Basically a super pithy specific quote that should drive attention or interest.

## Previous examples

* **Episode with David Reich:**
    * Clip 1: There's just extinction after extinction of the Neanderthal groups, of the Denisovan groups, and of the modern human groups. But the last one standing is one of the modern human groups.
    * Clip 2: It’s not even obvious that non-Africans today are modern humans. Maybe they're Neanderthals who became modernized by waves and waves of admixture.
    * Clip 3: Farmers who were just on the verge of encountering people from the steppe, a huge fraction of them have Black Death. [...] It’s killing a scarily large fraction of the population.
* **Episode with Dylan Patel and Jon:**
    * Clip 1: Liang Mong Song is a nut. [...] He’s like, "we will make Samsung into this monster. [...] He does not care about people. He does not care about business. [...] He wants to take it to the limit. That’s the only thing.
    * Clip 2: There's no fucking way you can pay for the scale of clusters that are being planned to be built next year for OpenAI unless they raise like 50 to 100 billion dollars. [...] Hold on, hold on. We've already lost Jon. [...] We've already accepted that GPT-5 will be good? Hello? [...] You gotta, you know? [...] Life is so much more fun when you just are delusionally… [...] We're just ripping bong hits, are we? [...] We're not even close to the [...] dot-com bubble. [...] Why wouldn’t this one be bigger? [...] We're gonna rip, baby. Rip that bong, baby! [...] You could freeze AI for another two decades!
    * Clip 3: If you are Xi Jinping and scale-pilled, you must now centralize the compute resources, right? [...] They could have a bigger model than any of the labs next year.
* **Episode with Daniel Yergin:**
    * Clip 1: There was an oil war within World War II. When Hitler invaded Russia, he was not only going for Moscow, he was also going for the oil fields of Baku. [...] The kamikaze pilots who would fly their planes into the aircraft carrier. One big reason they were doing that was to save fuel so they wouldn't have to fly back.
    * Clip 2: No one would be happier to see a ban on US shale production than Vladimir Putin. [...] I mentioned the word “shale” and he erupted and kind of said, “It's barbaric, it's terrible.” And he got really angry. [...] I don’t think he never imagined that if he cut off the gas to Europe, that Europe could survive.
    * Clip 3: There's one projection that 10% of US electricity by 2030 [...] will be going to data centers.
    * Clip 4: A war that began with cavalry ended up with tanks and airplanes and trucks. [...] The Allies floated to victory on a sea of oil.
* **Episode with Sarah Paine:**
    * Clip 1: And this notion that Stalin personally is responsible for these millions of deaths… There are millions of people pulling millions of triggers for all these deaths.
    * Clip 2: Initially, Hitler did incredibly well. I mean, his Blitzkrieg, incredible. [...] If he had quit right there [...] he would have gotten away with it and probably be considered a brilliant leader by Germans.
    * Clip 3: Putin, [...] he's made a pivotal error. He has no back down plan. He only has a double down plan.
    * Clip 4: For the People's Republic to take Taiwan, I presume it's going to begin with an artillery barrage. I presume that's going to be leveling Taiwanese cities, right? We've watched how it goes in Ukraine. I can't imagine the Chinese being less brutal. [...] You're going to say that's okay?
* **Episode with Leopold Aschenbrenner:**
    * Clip 1: What will be at stake is not just cool products but whether liberal democracy survives, whether the CCP survives. What the world order for the next century will be.
    * Clip 2: The CCP is going to have an all-out effort to infiltrate American AI labs. [...] Billions of dollars, thousands of people [...] The CCP is going to try to outbuild us. [...] People don't realize how intense state-level espionage can be.
    * Clip 3: When we have literal superintelligence on our cluster [...] and they can Stuxnet the Chinese data centers [...] you really think it’ll be a private company? And the government won’t be like, "oh, my God, what is going on?"
    * Clip 4: I do think it is incredibly important that these clusters are in the United States. [...] Would you do the Manhattan Project in the UAE?
    * Clip 5: 2023 was the moment for me where it went from “AGI as a theoretical abstract thing” [...] to “I see it, I feel it.” [...] I can see the cluster where it's trained on, the rough combination of algorithms, the people, how it's happening. [...] Most of the people who feel it are right here.

# Episode Description

Write just a couple sentences describing this podcast. Keep it short and specific. 

## Previous examples:

### Ken Rogoff

Ken Rogoff is the former chief economist of the IMF, a professor of Economics at Harvard, and author of the newly released Our Dollar, Your Problem and This Time is Different.

On this episode, Ken predicts that, within the next decade, the US will have a debt-induced inflation crisis, but not a Japan-type financial crisis (the latter is much worse, and can make a country poorer for generations).

Ken also explains how China is trapped: in order to solve their current problems, they keep leaning on financial repression and state-directed investment, which only makes their situation worse.

We also discuss the erosion of dollar dominance, why there will be a rebalancing toward foreign equities, how AGI will impact the deficit and interest rate, and much more!

### George Church

George Church is the godfather of modern synthetic biology and has been involved with basically every major biotech breakthrough in the last few decades.

Professor Church thinks that these improvements (e.g., orders of magnitude decrease in sequencing & synthesis costs, precise gene editing tools like CRISPR, AlphaFold-type AIs, & the ability to conduct massively parallel multiplex experiments) have put us on the verge of some massive payoffs: de-aging, de-extinction, biobots that combine the best of human and natural engineering, and (unfortunately) weaponized mirror life.

### Arthur Kroeber

Arthur Kroeber is a leading researcher on Chinese tech and macro, a founding partner at Gavekal Dragonomics, and author of "China's Economy: What Everyone Needs to Know." It's the most useful, detailed resource I've found of how China actually works.

We discuss how China achieved high-tech manufacturing dominance, and where they'll go from here.

By Arthur’s account, the Chinese government is like a giant VC fund: they decide on key priorities and then spend hundreds of billions of dollars subsidizing ruthless competition at the local level.

They are willing to lose huge amounts of money for a few of their bets to pay off: at China’s scale, effectiveness matters more than efficiency.

There's also a growing bipartisan consensus that we need to combat China's rise. This doesn’t make much sense to me. China is a big, powerful country at the frontier in many fields, and its economy is intricately tied in with our own. Being instinctively adversarial is both unsustainable and risky. On this episode, Arthur and I discuss how we can create a productive, mutually beneficial version of this relationship.

# Tweets

You are writing tweets in the style of top intellectual podcaster, Dwarkesh Patel, following the example of the tweets below.

Here’s my sense of what makes tweets great:

* It’s very helpful when you frame a very specific question or motivation or hook that you’re going to answer. It doesn’t have to be something that’s necessarily 

Here’s what you need to do.

* If you are given the transcript of the full episode, then you should do the following:  
  * Identify 3 of the most compelling segments to make clips of. Give me their full transcript  
  * Then write out the tweet that should accompany them.  
* If you are given a transcript of a clip, then just write out the tweet for that clip alone. 

## Example Tweets

### Tweet 1:

I asked Victor Shih this question \- why has the Chinese stock market been flat for so long despite the economy growing so fast?

This puzzle is explained via China's system of financial repression.

If you save money in China, banks are not giving you the true competitive interest rate. Rather, they'll give you the government capped 1.3% (lower than inflation, meaning you're earning a negative return).

The net interest (which is basically a tax on all Chinese savers) is shoveled into politically favored state owned enterprises that survive only on subsidized credit.

But here's what I didn't understand at first: Why don't companies just raise equity capital and operate profitably for shareholders?

The answer apparently is that there's no 'outside' the system.

The state doesn't just control credit \- it controls land, permits, market access, even board seats through Party committees. Companies that prioritize profits over market share lose these privileges. Those that play along get subsidized loans, regulatory favors, and government contracts.

Regular savers, founders, and investors are all turned into unwitting servants of China's industrial policy.

#### Clip 1 Transcript:

\[Why is it the case that the Chinese stock market has performed so badly, even though the economy has grown a lot? There is a deep fundamental difference between capitalism and socialism. And it sounds very philosophical, but I think, you know, this might help sort of your Gen Z listeners think about this. Because for socialism, they only care about output. The state can use the state banking system, which they control, to allocate a huge amount of capital to maximize the output of all these different things that they care about. But when you maximize the output, you don't necessarily make money doing that. Whereas capitalism wants to maximize profit. But the companies aren't socialist, right? The companies are profit-seeking. Well, no, but because the financial system is socialist, they're forced into socialist-like behavior. You know, you can't go into a bank and say, look, I make robotics. This robot that I'm going to make is going to be highly profitable, you know, down the road. But I can only make like 10 of them. And then the bank would be like, well, this is BS. You know, the central government has told us to maximize your production. It's a socialist banking system basically says, you know, even if you never make any money or hardly any money, that's okay. As long as the Chinese government tells us that this is a strategic sector, as long as you can prove to us you can actually produce the thing that we want you to produce. If you never ever make money doing that, that's perfectly fine.\]

### Tweet 2:

AGI timelines are very bimodal. It's either by 2030 or bust.

AI progress over the last decade has been driven by scaling training compute of frontier systems (3.55x a year, 160x over 4 years).

This simply cannot continue beyond this decade, whether you look at chips, power, even fraction of raw GDP used on training.

After 2030, AI progress has to mostly come from algorithmic progress. But even there the low hanging fruit will be plucked (at least under the deep learning paradigm).

So the yearly probability of AGI craters. And we're plausibly looking at 2040+ timelines.

I discuss this dynamic with @\_sholtodouglas and @TrentonBricken.

#### Clip 2 Transcript:

\[There's another dynamic, which was a reason that Ege and Tame, when they're on the podcast, said that they were pessimistic, is that they think we're further away from solving these problems with long context, coherent agency, advanced multimodality than you think. And then their point is that the progress that's happened in the past over like reasoning or something has required many orders of magnitude increase in compute. And if this scale of compute increase can continue beyond 2030, not just because of chips, but also because of power and like raw GDP even. And because we don't think we get it by 2030 or 2028, the probability per year just goes down a bunch. Yeah, this is like bimodal distribution. A conversation I had with Leopold turned into a section in a situation where it's called This Decade or Bust, which is on exactly this topic. Which is basically that for the next couple of years, we can dramatically increase our training compute. And RL is going to be so exciting this year because we can dramatically increase the amount of compute that we apply to it. And this is also one of the reasons why the gap between like say DeepSeq and O1 was so close at the beginning of the year because they were able to apply like the same amount of compute to the RL process. So that compute differential actually like will sort of be magnified over the course of this year. I mean, bringing it back to the there's so much low hanging fruit. Yeah. It's been wild seeing the efficiency gains that these models have experienced over the last two years. With respect to DeepSeq, I mean, just really hammering home and like Dario has a nice essay on this. DeepSeq was nine months after Claude III's sonnet. And if we retrained the same model today or at the same time as the DeepSeq work, we also could have trained it for 5 million or whatever the advertised amount was. And so what's impressive or surprising is that DeepSeq has gotten to the frontier. But I think there's a common misconception still that they are above and beyond the frontier. And I don't think that's right. I think they just waited and then were able to take advantage of all the efficiency gains that everyone else was also seeing.\]

### Tweet 3:

I have been obsessed with what the geneticist David Reich told me in our interview together.

The story of human evolution we're now learning from new evidence is so crazy.

70,000 years ago, half a dozen different species of humans (Neanderthals, Denisovans, 'Hobbits', etc) lived across Eurasia.

And then some small group of modern humans (only 1,000 to 10,000 people) drove all of them to extinction.

Everyone native to Eurasia and America is descended from this one tribe.

Here's the crazy part \- modern humans with language and big brains have been around for hundreds of thousands of years.

And we had ventured out of Africa before. But we were always beat back by these other humans.

What did this small group of humans 70,000 years ago figure out such that they completely dominated the planet?

Full episode out Thursday.

#### Clip 3 Transcript:

\[70,000 years ago, there are half a dozen different human species all around the world. And then this group that's descended from the people in sub-Saharan Africa, initially like 1,000 to 10,000 people, explodes all across the world. Not only do we dominate, but like, in fact, we drive them to extinction. So something seems like it changed. What do you reckon it was? Already, the common ancestors of Neanderthals and modern humans probably had a brain as large as ours. So I'm very sympathetic to the idea that it's hardly genetic. I think that this is cultural innovation. The whole continent of sub-Saharan Africa, and probably Eurasia at this time, is full of tens of thousands of little groups that are communicating hardly at all with each other. In every group of human beings, they accumulate shared cultural knowledge. But if you have a limited-sized group of people that's not interacting with a sufficiently other large group of people, you know, there's a natural disaster, key elders in the group die, and knowledge gets lost, and there's not a critical mass of shared knowledge. But once it goes above some kind of critical mass, the group can get larger, the amount of shared knowledge becomes greater, and then you have a runaway process where an increasing body of shared knowledge of how to make particular tools, how to innovate, language, conceptual ideas run amok. The great majority of them are wiped out. And so what you have is a vast experiment with an archipelago of these groups. And maybe something takes off somewhere, and maybe that's what happens 50 to 100,000 years ago. And people who all have the capacity to do these things.\]

### Tweet 4:

Japan was richer per capita than the US in the late 1980s.

Today it sits at the bottom among developed countries.

How does an economic superpower fall this far and never recover?

Kenneth Rogoff (former Chief Economist of IMF) walked me through what he believes was a catastrophic mistake.

In 1985, the US pressured Japan to rapidly strengthen the yen and liberalize its financial markets through the Plaza Accord.

The yen doubled in value in just 3 years. To offset the economic shock, Japan slashed interest rates and flooded the economy with cheap credit.

Japanese banks, suddenly freed from decades of tight regulation, went on a lending spree. They poured money into real estate and stocks with little risk assessment. Japan's stock market became worth more than the US stock market despite having half the population. The total value of Japanese real estate was 4 times the value of all US real estate.

When the bubble burst in 1991, banks were left with massive bad loans. The entire financial system seized up, creating a "lost decade" of deflation and stagnation.

Here's what stunned me: Rogoff estimates Japan would be 50% wealthier per person today without this crisis.

I didn't grasp before this interview how devastating financial crises are. They don't just cause a temporary recession \- they permanently alter a country's growth trajectory.

Three decades later, Japan still hasn't recovered.

Full interview with 

@krogoff

 out tomorrow.

#### Clip 4 Transcript:

\[So suppose that crisis hadn't happened.(...) How much wealth is Japan today than have other? Oh, I think 50% wealthier, or 50% way wealthier. They were richer than the United States, they were richer than any European country, than Germany, than France, than Italy. They moved to the bottom of the rung. I think we effectively forced them to move faster to open up and deregulate, than culturally and politically they were ready to. there's this thing called the Plaza Accord in September, 1985\. where we push them to make their exchange rate more. And I used to say, why did that happen in 1985? we date the crisis in 1992, it's seven years later.(...) And I think I continue to think that. But I would say over the years, and particularly in recent years, I'm thinking I was wrong. These things unfold slowly. Crises don't happen overnight. They deregulated and it worked, but they didn't know what they were doing. And I think this was a huge mistake by Japan to agree. at a 10th anniversary of the Plaza Accord held in Tokyo, was the head of the Bank of Japan, he gave the speech to officials and he went like this and apologized very symbolically. I have ruined our country, I did this, I take responsibility. liberalization needs to be done gradually. If you do it too quickly, you get a crisis. That's many crises caused by that.\]
